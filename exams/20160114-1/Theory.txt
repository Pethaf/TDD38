1. Data member is const, reference or of class type that can't be default initialized
2. Value can be modified through const object and const member functions.
3. inline namespace is a namespace that is implicitly used in the declaration context
   namespace a {
   namespace b {
      ...
   }
   using namespace b;
}


namespace a {
   inline namespace b {
      ...
   }
}

4.
 1. Try to find non-template version that matches call perfectely
 2. Try to find template version that can be instantiated to match call
 3. Try to find non-template call that matches uniquely best through implicit conversion

5.
  vector<int> {2,3}; -> vector with 2 ints, value 2,3.
  vector<int>(2,3); -> vector with 2 ints, value 3.

First call matches vector(std::initializer_list<T>)
Second call matches vector(size_t, int)
