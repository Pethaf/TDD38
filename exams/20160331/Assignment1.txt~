#1 template <typename T>
T max(T,T) { }
     int i;
double d;
max(i,d);

Template type arguments are not implicitly converted. Thus there is no way for the compiler to instantiate a function from int and double.
max<double>(i,d);

#2 Unnamed namespace is a namespace without a name, declaring such a namespace localizes the namespace to the enclosing file.

#3 non-static, non-const, non-reference member data member declared as mutable -> member functions declared as const allowed to alter them, allowed to change them through const object.
 lambda function declared as mutable -> lambda object allowed to change captured variables.

#4 Non-explicit 1-parameter constructor,
   class T
   {
     T(U) { ... } 
   }
  Type-conversion operator

  class T
  {
    operator U() { ... } 
  }

#5 

    class Foo
    {
      Foo(int i, double j, double k): var1(i),var2(j),var3(k) { }
      Foo(int i): Foo(i,0.0,0.0) { } 
    }
